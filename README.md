## Packman

I started this repository with nothing particular in mind, I just wanted to play
around with SFML. But then I had the idea of making a packman game, which is
what I did. Now this is my packman repository, but I might add some other games
later.

Download it by running

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/shak-mar/cpp-games

Build and run it with my build setup:

    python build.py @build_and_run packman

You will end up in a splashscreen (currently a 16x16 yellow placeholder :D),
press space to continue into the actual game.

The level you will end up in is not that impressive and fun at all. If you want
to have some fun, you can edit application/packman/res/levels/example.txt. You
may open pull requests if you have built levels that are fun.
