# Packman Repository

## Template

This Repository uses [my c++ project template][cpp-template]

[cpp-template]: github.com/shak-mar/cpp-template

## Packman

I started this repository with nothing particular in mind, I just wanted to play
around with SFML. But then I had the idea of making a packman game, which is
what I did. Now this is my packman repository, but I might add some other games
later.

You can try it out by running

    $ git clone --depth 1 github.com/shark-mar/cpp-games
    $ python build.py @build_and_run packman

Have fun!
